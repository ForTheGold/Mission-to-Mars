# Mission-to-Mars

Web Scraping data about space and saving it to a MongoDB and presenting in Flask

##  Background

Robin is a data scientist who does freelance astronomy work in her free time.  Her dream is to land a position with NASA someday in the future.  She spends a lot of time visiting sites about space exploration.  One time while looking at this data, she came up with the idea to build a script that gathers all of the data that she looks for and organizes it into one convenient location.

### Purpose

She would also like to display this data on a web page so that other people who are interested in astronomy may view the data and perhaps even get the attention of NASA.  She decides that she would like to gather data and display it in one central location so that she does not need to gather the data manually.

### Technologies

Robin would like to build a web application that will scrape the data that she tells it to with the click of a button.  Robin needs to learn about how web pages are built in order to scrape the data, and then come up with a place to store the data.  She has decided to use BeautifulSoup for the web scraping, and MongoDB for the storage.  Robin is choosing to use a NoSQL database because it allows for a greater degree of flexibility than a structured SQL DataBase.

All of this data will be put together into a web application so that the data may be viewed by other astronomers.  In order to create this display, Robin is going to use Flask which is a web framework that allows for creating web applications in Python.  It also allows for customization using HTML and CSS.

## Results

The web application goes onto the NASA website and scrapes a variety of different data with just the click of a button.  The button that needs to be clicked to do the data scraping as well as some of the scraped data can be viewed in the following image.

The data that gets scraped is the top article and description from the website viewable above along with the top image and table data about the differences between earth and mars viewable below.  The final image shows scraped images of the mars hemispheres.

## Conclusion

Robin had serious interest in astronomy and was able to use her knowledge of data science and programming in order to build a web application that displays the data that she needs.
